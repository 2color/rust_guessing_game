# Rust Guessing Game

As part of my rust learning process I'm publishing the completed tasks with some notes for future reference.
This should match the guessing game from the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/guessing-game.html). 


## Running
To run this [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) needs to be installed.
Once installed 
```
$cargo run
```


## Topics covered
 - let and type inference 
 - annotating types `guess: u32`
 - match statements
 - Result type (ties closely together with match statements)
 - methods
 - associated functions (like static methods) prefixed with `::`
 - external crates
